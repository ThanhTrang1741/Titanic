# Titanic

# **1. Introdution**

On April 15, 1912, during the maiden voyage of Titanic, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

**Random Forest** used to the answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
